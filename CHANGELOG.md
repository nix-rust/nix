### Changed

- `FdSet::{contains, highest, fds}` no longer require a mutable reference.
  (#[1464](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1464))
- `User::gecos` and corresponding `libc::passwd::pw_gecos` are supported on
  64-bit Android, change conditional compilation to include the field in
  64-bit Android builds
  (#[1471](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1471))
- `eventfd`s are supported on Android, change conditional compilation to
  include `sys::eventfd::eventfd` and `sys::eventfd::EfdFlags`for Android
  builds.
  (#[1481](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1481))

- Most enums that come from C, for example `Errno`, are now marked as
  `#[non_exhaustive]`.
  (#[1474](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1474))

- Many more functions, mostly contructors, are now `const`.
  (#[1476](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1476))
  (#[1492](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1492))

- `sys::event::KEvent::filter` now returns a `Result` instead of being
  infalliable.  The only cases where it will now return an error are cases
  where it previously would've had undefined behavior.
  (#[1484](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1484))

- Minimum supported Rust version is now 1.46.0.
  ([#1492](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1492))

### Fixed

- Added more errno definitions for better backwards compatibility with
  Nix 0.21.0.
  (#[1467](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1467))

- Fixed potential undefined behavior in `Signal::try_from` on some platforms.
  (#[1484](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1484))

### Removed

- Removed a couple of termios constants on redox that were never actually
  supported.
  (#[1483](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1483))
- Removed `nix::sys::signal::NSIG`.  It was of dubious utility, and not correct
  for all platforms.
  (#[1484](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1484))

- Removed support for 32-bit Apple targets, since they've been dropped by both
  Rustc and Xcode.
  (#[1492](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1492))

- Deprecated `SockAddr/InetAddr::to_str` in favor of `ToString::to_string`
  (#[1495](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1495))

## [0.22.0] - 9 July 2021
### Added
- Added `if_nameindex` (#[1445](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1445))
- Added `nmount` for FreeBSD.
  (#[1453](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1453))
- Added `IpFreebind` socket option (sockopt) on Linux, Fuchsia and Android.
  (#[1456](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1456))
- Added `TcpUserTimeout` socket option (sockopt) on Linux and Fuchsia.
  (#[1457](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1457))
- Added `renameat2` for Linux
  (#[1458](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1458))
- Added `RxqOvfl` support on Linux, Fuchsia and Android.
  (#[1455](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1455))

### Changed
- `ptsname_r` now returns a lossily-converted string in the event of bad UTF,
  just like `ptsname`.
  ([#1446](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1446))
- Nix's error type is now a simple wrapper around the platform's Errno.  This
  means it is now `Into<std::io::Error>`.  It's also `Clone`, `Copy`, `Eq`, and
  has a small fixed size.  It also requires less typing.  For example, the old
  enum variant `nix::Error::Sys(nix::errno::Errno::EINVAL)` is now simply
  `nix::Error::EINVAL`.
  ([#1446](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1446))

### Fixed
### Removed

## [0.21.0] - 31 May 2021
### Added
- Added `getresuid` and `getresgid`
  (#[1430](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1430))
- Added TIMESTAMPNS support for linux
  (#[1402](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1402))
- Added `sendfile64` (#[1439](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1439))
- Added `MS_LAZYTIME` to `MsFlags`
  (#[1437](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1437))

### Changed
- Made `forkpty` unsafe, like `fork`
  (#[1390](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1390))
- Made `Uid`, `Gid` and `Pid` methods `from_raw` and `as_raw` a `const fn`
  (#[1429](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1429))
- Made `Uid::is_root` a `const fn`
  (#[1429](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1429))
- `AioCb` is now always pinned.  Once a `libc::aiocb` gets sent to the kernel,
  its address in memory must not change.  Nix now enforces that by using
  `std::pin`.  Most users won't need to change anything, except when using
  `aio_suspend`.  See that method's documentation for the new usage.
  (#[1440](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1440))
- `LioCb` is now constructed using a distinct `LioCbBuilder` struct.  This
  avoids a soundness issue with the old `LioCb`.  Usage is similar but
  construction now uses the builder pattern.  See the documentation for
  details.
  (#[1440](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1440))
- Minimum supported Rust version is now 1.41.0.
  ([#1440](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1440))
- Errno aliases are now associated consts on `Errno`, instead of consts in the
  `errno` module.
  (#[1452](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1452))

### Fixed
- Allow `sockaddr_ll` size, as reported by the Linux kernel, to be smaller then it's definition
  (#[1395](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1395))
- Fix spurious errors using `sendmmsg` with multiple cmsgs
  (#[1414](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1414))
- Added `Errno::EOPNOTSUPP` to FreeBSD, where it was missing.
  (#[1452](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1452))

### Removed

- Removed `sys::socket::accept4` from Android arm because libc removed it in
  version 0.2.87.
  ([#1399](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1399))
- `AioCb::from_boxed_slice` and `AioCb::from_boxed_mut_slice` have been
  removed.  They were useful with earlier versions of Rust, but should no
  longer be needed now that async/await are available.  `AioCb`s now work
  exclusively with borrowed buffers, not owned ones.
  (#[1440](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1440))
- Removed some Errno values from platforms where they aren't actually defined.
  (#[1452](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1452))

- Implemented `IntoIterator` for `Dir`
  (#[1333](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1333)).

### Changed

- Minimum supported Rust version is now 1.40.0.
  ([#1356](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1356))
- i686-apple-darwin has been demoted to Tier 2 support, because it's deprecated
  by Xcode.
  (#[1350](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1350))
- Fixed calling `recvfrom` on an `AddrFamily::Packet` socket
  (#[1344](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1344))

  (#[1362](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1362))
- Removed both `Copy` and `Clone` from `TimerFd`.
  ([#1381](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1381))

  (#[1289](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1289))
- Added `clock_gettime`, `clock_settime`, `clock_getres`,
  `clock_getcpuclockid` functions and `ClockId` struct.
  (#[1281](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1281))
- Added wrapper functions for `PTRACE_SYSEMU` and `PTRACE_SYSEMU_SINGLESTEP`.
  (#[1300](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1300))

  (#[1278](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1278))
- Made `unistd::fork` an unsafe funtion, bringing it in line with [libstd's decision](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/58059).
  (#[1293](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1293))
### Fixed
### Removed

- Enabled `sys::ptrace::setregs` and `sys::ptrace::getregs` on x86_64-unknown-linux-musl target
  (#[1198](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1198))
- On Linux, `ptrace::write` is now an `unsafe` function. Caveat programmer.
  (#[1245](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1245))
- `execv`, `execve`, `execvp` and `execveat` in `::nix::unistd` and `reboot` in
  `::nix::sys::reboot` now return `Result<Infallible>` instead of `Result<Void>` (#[1239](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1239))
- `sys::socket::sockaddr_storage_to_addr` is no longer `unsafe`.  So is
  `offset_of!`.
- `sys::socket::sockaddr_storage_to_addr`, `offset_of!`, and `Errno::clear` are
  no longer `unsafe`.
- `SockAddr::as_ffi_pair`,`sys::socket::sockaddr_storage_to_addr`, `offset_of!`,
  and `Errno::clear` are no longer `unsafe`.
  (#[1244](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1244))
- Several `Inotify` methods now take `self` by value instead of by reference
  (#[1244](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1244))
- `nix::poll::ppoll`: `timeout` parameter is now optional, None is equivalent for infinite timeout.

### Fixed

- Fixed `getsockopt`.  The old code produced UB which triggers a panic with
  Rust 1.44.0.
  (#[1214](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1214))

- Fixed a bug in nix::unistd that would result in an infinite loop
  when a group or user lookup required a buffer larger than
  16KB. (#[1198](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1198))
- Fixed unaligned casting of `cmsg_data` to `af_alg_iv` (#[1206](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1206))
- Fixed `readlink`/`readlinkat` when reading symlinks longer than `PATH_MAX` (#[1231](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1231))
- `PollFd`, `EpollEvent`, `IpMembershipRequest`, `Ipv6MembershipRequest`,
  `TimeVal`, and `IoVec` are now `repr(transparent)`.  This is required for
  correctness's sake across all architectures and compilers, though now bugs
  have been reported so far.
  (#[1243](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1243))
- Fixed unaligned pointer read in `Inotify::read_events`.
  (#[1244](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1244))

### Removed

- Removed `sys::socket::addr::from_libc_sockaddr` from the public API.
  (#[1215](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1215))
- Removed `sys::termios::{get_libc_termios, get_libc_termios_mut, update_wrapper`
  from the public API. These were previously hidden in the docs but still usable
  by downstream.
  (#[1235](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1235))

- Nix no longer implements `NixPath` for `Option<P> where P: NixPath`.  Most
  Nix functions that accept `NixPath` arguments can't do anything useful with
  `None`.  The exceptions (`mount` and `quotactl_sync`) already take explicitly
  optional arguments.
  (#[1242](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1242))

- Removed `unistd::daemon` and `unistd::pipe2` on OSX and ios
  (#[1255](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1255))

- Removed `sys::event::FilterFlag::NOTE_EXIT_REPARENTED` and
  `sys::event::FilterFlag::NOTE_REAP` on OSX and ios.
  (#[1255](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1255))

- Removed `sys::ptrace::ptrace` on Android and Linux.
  (#[1255](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1255))

- Dropped support for powerpc64-unknown-linux-gnu
  (#[1266](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1268))

  (#[1177](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1177))
### Changed
### Fixed
### Removed
- Removed deprecated Error::description from error types
  (#[1175](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1175))

## [0.16.1] - 23 December 2019
### Added
### Changed
### Fixed

- Fixed the build for OpenBSD
  (#[1168](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1168))

### Removed

## [0.16.0] - 1 December 2019
### Added
- Added `ptrace::seize()`: similar to `attach()` on Linux
  but with better-defined semantics.
  (#[1154](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1154))

- Added `Signal::as_str()`: returns signal name as `&'static str`
  (#[1138](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1138))

- Added `posix_fallocate`.
  ([#1105](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1105))

  ([#1107](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1107))

- Added `NixPath::is_empty`.
  ([#1107](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1107))

- Added `mkfifoat`
  ([#1133](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1133))

- Added `User::from_uid`, `User::from_name`, `User::from_gid` and
  `Group::from_name`,
  ([#1139](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1139))

- Added `linkat`
  ([#1101](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1101))

- Added `sched_getaffinity`.
  ([#1148](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1148))

- Added optional `Signal` argument to `ptrace::{detach, syscall}` for signal
  injection. ([#1083](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1083))

### Changed
- `sys::termios::BaudRate` now implements `TryFrom<speed_t>` instead of
  `From<speed_t>`.  The old `From` implementation would panic on failure.
  ([#1159](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1159))

- `sys::socket::ControlMessage::ScmCredentials` and
  `sys::socket::ControlMessageOwned::ScmCredentials` now wrap `UnixCredentials`
  rather than `libc::ucred`.
  ([#1160](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1160))

- `sys::socket::recvmsg` now takes a plain `Vec` instead of a `CmsgBuffer`
  implementor.  If you were already using `cmsg_space!`, then you needn't worry.
  ([#1156](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1156))

- `sys::socket::recvfrom` now returns
  `Result<(usize, Option<SockAddr>)>` instead of `Result<(usize, SockAddr)>`.
  ([#1145](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1145))

- `Signal::from_c_int` has been replaced by `Signal::try_from`
  ([#1113](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1113))

- Changed `readlink` and `readlinkat` to return `OsString`
  ([#1109](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1109))

  ```rust
  # use nix::fcntl::{readlink, readlinkat};
  // the buffer argument of `readlink` and `readlinkat` has been removed,
  // and the return value is now an owned type (`OsString`).
  // Existing code can be updated by removing the buffer argument
  // and removing any clone or similar operation on the output

  // old code `readlink(&path, &mut buf)` can be replaced with the following
  let _: OsString = readlink(&path);

  // old code `readlinkat(dirfd, &path, &mut buf)` can be replaced with the following
  let _: OsString = readlinkat(dirfd, &path);
  ```

- Minimum supported Rust version is now 1.36.0.
  ([#1108](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1108))

- `Ipv4Addr::octets`, `Ipv4Addr::to_std`, `Error::as_errno`,
  `ForkResult::is_child`, `ForkResult::is_parent`, `Gid::as_raw`,
  `Uid::is_root`, `Uid::as_raw`, `Pid::as_raw`, and `PollFd::revents` now take
  `self` by value.
  ([#1107](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1107))

- Type `&CString` for parameters of `exec(v|ve|vp|vpe|veat)` are changed to `&CStr`.
  ([#1121](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1121))

### Fixed
- Fix length of abstract socket addresses
  ([#1120](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1120))

- Fix initialization of msghdr in recvmsg/sendmsg when built with musl
  ([#1136](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1136))

### Removed
- Remove the deprecated `CmsgSpace`.
  ([#1156](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1156))

## [0.15.0] - 10 August 2019

  ```

  By replacing it with code like this:
  ```rust

  `from_bytes` or `from_bytes_mut` instead.
  ([#820](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/820))
- The syscall module has been removed. This only exposed enough functionality for
  `memfd_create()` and `pivot_root()`, which are still exposed as separate functions.
  ([#747](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/747))
- The `Errno` variants are no longer reexported from the `errno` module. `Errno` itself is no longer reexported from the

- Added `nix::ptrace::{ptrace_get_data, ptrace_getsiginfo, ptrace_setsiginfo
  and nix::Error::UnsupportedOperation}`
  ([#614](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/614))
- Added `cfmakeraw`, `cfsetspeed`, and `tcgetsid`. ([#527](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/527))
- Added "bad none", "bad write_ptr", "bad write_int", and "bad readwrite" variants to the `ioctl!`
  macro. ([#670](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/670))
- On Linux and Android, added support for receiving `PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD`
  events from `wait` and `waitpid` using `WaitStatus::PtraceSyscall`
  ([#566](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/566)).

### Changed
- The `ioctl!` macro and its variants now allow the generated functions to have
  doccomments. ([#661](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/661))
- Changed `ioctl!(write ...)` into `ioctl!(write_ptr ...)` and `ioctl!(write_int ..)` variants
  to more clearly separate those use cases. ([#670](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/670))
- Marked `sys::mman::{ mmap, munmap, madvise, munlock, msync }` as unsafe.
  ([#559](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/559))
- Minimum supported Rust version is now 1.13.
- Removed `revents` argument from `PollFd::new()` as it's an output argument and
  will be overwritten regardless of value.
  ([#542](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/542))
- Changed type signature of `sys::select::FdSet::contains` to make `self`
  immutable ([#564](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/564))
- Introduced wrapper types for `gid_t`, `pid_t`, and `uid_t` as `Gid`, `Pid`, and `Uid`
  respectively. Various functions have been changed to use these new types as
  arguments. ([#629](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/629))
- Fixed compilation on all Android and iOS targets ([#527](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/527))
  and promoted them to Tier 2 support.
- `nix::sys::statfs::{statfs,fstatfs}` uses statfs definition from `libc::statfs` instead of own linux specific type `nix::sys::Statfs`.
  Also file system type constants like `nix::sys::statfs::ADFS_SUPER_MAGIC` were removed in favor of the libc equivalent.
  ([#561](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/561))
- Revised the termios API including additional tests and documentation and exposed it on iOS. ([#527](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/527))
- `eventfd`, `signalfd`, and `pwritev`/`preadv` functionality is now included by default for all
  supported platforms. ([#681](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/561))
- The `ioctl!` macro's plain variants has been replaced with "bad read" to be consistent with
  other variants. The generated functions also have more strict types for their arguments. The
  "*_buf" variants also now calculate total array size and take slice references for improved type
  safety. The documentation has also been dramatically improved.
  ([#670](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/670))

### Removed
- Removed `io::Error` from `nix::Error` and the conversion from `nix::Error` to `Errno`
  ([#614](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/614))
- All feature flags have been removed in favor of conditional compilation on supported platforms.
  `execvpe` is no longer supported, but this was already broken and will be added back in the next
  release. ([#681](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/561))
- Removed `ioc_*` functions and many helper constants and macros within the `ioctl` module. These
  should always have been private and only the `ioctl!` should be used in public code.
  ([#670](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/670))

### Fixed
- Fixed multiple issues compiling under different archetectures and OSes.
  Now compiles on Linux/MIPS ([#538](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/538)),
  `Linux/PPC` ([#553](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/553)),
  `MacOS/x86_64,i686` ([#553](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/553)),
  `NetBSD/x64_64` ([#538](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/538)),
  `FreeBSD/x86_64,i686` ([#536](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/536)), and
  `Android` ([#631](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/631)).
- `bind` and `errno_location` now work correctly on `Android`
  ([#631](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/631))
- Added `nix::ptrace` on all Linux-kernel-based platforms
  [#624](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/624). Previously it was
  only available on x86, x86-64, and ARM, and also not on Android.
- Fixed `sys::socket::sendmsg` with zero entry `cmsgs` parameter.
  ([#623](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/623))
- Multiple constants related to the termios API have now been properly defined for
  all supported platforms. ([#527](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/527))
- `ioctl!` macro now supports working with non-int datatypes and properly supports all platforms.
  ([#670](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/670))

## [0.8.1] 2017-04-16

### Fixed
- Fixed build on FreeBSD. (Cherry-picked
  [a859ee3c](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/commit/a859ee3c9396dfdb118fcc2c8ecc697e2d303467))

## [0.8.0] 2017-03-02

### Added
- Added `::nix::sys::termios::BaudRate` enum to provide portable baudrate
  values. ([#518](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/518))
- Added a new `WaitStatus::PtraceEvent` to support ptrace events on Linux
  and Android ([#438](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/438))

  ([#483](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/483))
- Added complete definitions for all kqueue-related constants on all supported
  OSes
  ([#415](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/415))
- Added function `epoll_create1` and bitflags `EpollCreateFlags` in
  `::nix::sys::epoll` in order to support `::libc::epoll_create1`.
  ([#410](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/410))
- Added `setresuid` and `setresgid` for Linux in `::nix::unistd`
  ([#448](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/448))
- Added `getpgid` in `::nix::unistd`
  ([#433](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/433))
- Added `tcgetpgrp` and `tcsetpgrp` in `::nix::unistd`
  ([#451](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/451))

  ([#491](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/491))
- Added `fchdir` in `::nix::unistd`
  ([#497](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/497))
- Added `major` and `minor` in `::nix::sys::stat` for decomposing `dev_t`
  ([#508](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/508))
- Fixed the style of many bitflags and use `libc` in more places.
  ([#503](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/503))
- Added `ppoll` in `::nix::poll`
  ([#520](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/520))
- Added support for getting and setting pipe size with fcntl(2) on Linux
  ([#540](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/540))

### Changed
- `::nix::sys::termios::{cfgetispeed, cfsetispeed, cfgetospeed, cfsetospeed}`
  switched  to use `BaudRate` enum from `speed_t`.
  ([#518](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/518))
- `epoll_ctl` now could accept None as argument `event`
  when op is `EpollOp::EpollCtlDel`.
  ([#480](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/480))
- Removed the `bad` keyword from the `ioctl!` macro
  ([#478](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/478))
- Changed `TimeVal` into an opaque Newtype
  ([#475](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/475))
- `kill`'s signature, defined in `::nix::sys::signal`, changed, so that the
  signal parameter has type `T: Into<Option<Signal>>`. `None` as an argument
  for that parameter will result in a 0 passed to libc's `kill`, while a
  `Some`-argument will result in the previous behavior for the contained
  `Signal`.
  ([#445](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/445))
- The minimum supported version of rustc is now 1.7.0.
  ([#444](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/444))
- Changed `KEvent` to an opaque structure that may only be modified by its
  constructor and the `ev_set` method.
  ([#415](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/415))
  ([#442](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/442))
  ([#463](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/463))
- `pipe2` now calls `libc::pipe2` where available. Previously it was emulated
  using `pipe`, which meant that setting `O_CLOEXEC` was not atomic.
  ([#427](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/427))
- Renamed `EpollEventKind` to `EpollFlags` in `::nix::sys::epoll` in order for
  it to conform with our conventions.
  ([#410](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/410))
- `EpollEvent` in `::nix::sys::epoll` is now an opaque proxy for
  `::libc::epoll_event`. The formerly public field `events` is now be read-only
  accessible with the new method `events()` of `EpollEvent`. Instances of
  `EpollEvent` can be constructed using the new method `new()` of EpollEvent.
  ([#410](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/410))
- `SigFlags` in `::nix::sys::signal` has be renamed to `SigmaskHow` and its type
  has changed from `bitflags` to `enum` in order to conform to our conventions.
  ([#460](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/460))
- `sethostname` now takes a `&str` instead of a `&[u8]` as this provides an API
  that makes more sense in normal, correct usage of the API.
- `gethostname` previously did not expose the actual length of the hostname
  written from the underlying system call at all.  This has been updated to
  return a `&CStr` within the provided buffer that is always properly
  NUL-terminated (this is not guaranteed by the call with all platforms/libc
  implementations).
- Exposed all fcntl(2) operations at the module level, so they can be
  imported direclty instead of via `FcntlArg` enum.
  ([#541](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/541))

### Fixed
- Fixed multiple issues with Unix domain sockets on non-Linux OSes
  ([#474](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/415))
- Fixed using kqueue with `EVFILT_USER` on FreeBSD
  ([#415](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/415))
- Fixed the build on FreeBSD, and fixed the getsockopt, sendmsg, and recvmsg
  functions on that same OS.
  ([#397](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/397))
- Fixed an off-by-one bug in `UnixAddr::new_abstract` in `::nix::sys::socket`.
  ([#429](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/429))
- Fixed clone passing a potentially unaligned stack.
  ([#490](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/490))
- Fixed mkdev not creating a `dev_t` the same way as libc.
  ([#508](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/508))

- Added `lseek` and `lseek64` in `::nix::unistd`
  ([#377](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/377))
- Added `mkdir` and `getcwd` in `::nix::unistd`
  ([#416](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/416))
- Added accessors `sigmask_mut` and `sigmask` to `UContext` in
  `::nix::ucontext`.
  ([#370](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/370))
- Added `WUNTRACED` to `WaitPidFlag` in `::nix::sys::wait` for non-_linux_
  targets.
  ([#379](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/379))
- Added new module `::nix::sys::reboot` with enumeration `RebootMode` and
  functions `reboot` and `set_cad_enabled`. Currently for _linux_ only.
  ([#386](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/386))
- `FdSet` in `::nix::sys::select` now also implements `Clone`.
  ([#405](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/405))

  ([#407](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/407))
- Added `CpuSet::unset` in `::nix::sched`.
  ([#402](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/402))
- Added constructor method `new()` to `PollFd` in `::nix::poll`, in order to
  allow creation of objects, after removing public access to members.
  ([#399](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/399))
- Added method `revents()` to `PollFd` in `::nix::poll`, in order to provide
  read access to formerly public member `revents`.
  ([#399](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/399))
- Added `MSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC` to `MsgFlags` in `::nix::sys::socket` for _linux_ only.
  ([#422](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/422))

### Changed
- Replaced the reexported integer constants for signals by the enumeration
  `Signal` in `::nix::sys::signal`.
  ([#362](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/362))
- Renamed `EventFdFlag` to `EfdFlags` in `::nix::sys::eventfd`.
  ([#383](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/383))
- Changed the result types of `CpuSet::is_set` and `CpuSet::set` in
  `::nix::sched` to `Result<bool>` and `Result<()>`, respectively. They now
  return `EINVAL`, if an invalid argument for the `field` parameter is passed.
  ([#402](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/402))
- `MqAttr` in `::nix::mqueue` is now an opaque proxy for `::libc::mq_attr`,
  which has the same structure as the old `MqAttr`. The field `mq_flags` of
  `::libc::mq_attr` is readable using the new method `flags()` of `MqAttr`.
  `MqAttr` also no longer implements `Debug`.
  ([#392](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/392))
- The parameter `msq_prio` of `mq_receive` with type `u32` in `::nix::mqueue`
  was replaced by a parameter named `msg_prio` with type `&mut u32`, so that
  the message priority can be obtained by the caller.
  ([#392](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/392))
- The type alias `MQd` in `::nix::queue` was replaced by the type alias
  `libc::mqd_t`, both of which are aliases for the same type.
  ([#392](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/392))

### Removed
- Type alias `SigNum` from `::nix::sys::signal`.
  ([#362](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/362))
- Type alias `CpuMask` from `::nix::shed`.
  ([#402](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/402))

  `revents()`.
  ([#399](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/399))

### Fixed
- Fixed the build problem for NetBSD (Note, that we currently do not support
  it, so it might already be broken again).
  ([#389](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/389))
- Fixed the build on FreeBSD, and fixed the getsockopt, sendmsg, and recvmsg
  functions on that same OS.
  ([#397](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/397))

## [0.6.0] 2016-06-10

  ([#359](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/359))
- Added `clear` and `extend` functions to `SigSet`'s implementation in
  `::nix::sys::signal`.
  ([#347](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/347))
- `sockaddr_storage_to_addr` in `::nix::sys::socket` now supports `sockaddr_nl`
  on _linux_ and _android_.
  ([#366](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/366))
- Added support for `SO_ORIGINAL_DST` in `::nix::sys::socket` on _linux_.
  ([#367](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/367))
- Added `SIGINFO` in `::nix::sys::signal` for the _macos_ target as well as
  `SIGPWR` and `SIGSTKFLT` in `::nix::sys::signal` for non-_macos_ targets.
  ([#361](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/361))

### Changed
- Changed the structure `IoVec` in `::nix::sys::uio`.
  ([#304](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/304))

  ([#344](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/344))
- `execv`, `execve`, and `execvp` now return `Result<Void>` instead of
  `Result<()>` in `::nix::unistd`.
  ([#357](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/357))

### Fixed
- Improved the conversion from `std::net::SocketAddr` to `InetAddr` in
  `::nix::sys::socket::addr`.
  ([#335](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/335))

## [0.5.0] 2016-03-01
