This pull request adds a new enum **SignalValue** that allows specifying both standard signals and real-time signals. For most functions, a new "real-time signal aware" version was added (for instance, for **sigaction()**, the new function is called **rt_sigaction()**). However, there are two significant changes:

* Turning **SigSet** into iterator now returns real-time signal aware **SignalSetIter** instead of the old **SigSetIter**
* The **signal** field of the **SigevSignal** and **SigevThreadId** structs is now of real-time signal aware type **SignalValue** instead of the old **Signal** type
