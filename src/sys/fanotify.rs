//! Monitoring API for filesystem events.
//!
//! Fanotify is a Linux-only API to monitor filesystems events.
//!
//! Additional capabilities compared to the `inotify` API include the ability to
//! monitor all of the objects in a mounted filesystem, the ability to make
//! access permission decisions, and the possibility to read or modify files
//! before access by other applications.
//!
//! For more documentation, please read
//! [fanotify(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/fanotify.7.html).
